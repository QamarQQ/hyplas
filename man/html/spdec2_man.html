 DESCRIPTION
 Closed form spectral decomposition of 2-D symmetric tensors        
                                                                    
 This routine performs the spectral decomposition of 2-D symmetric  
 tensors in closed form. The tensor is passed as argument (stored in
 vector form).                                                      
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   EIGPRJ <  Matrix with one eigenprojection tensor  
                              of X stored in each column.             

 double precision   EIGX   <  Array containing the eigenvalues of X.  

 logical            REPEAT <  Repeated eigenvalues flag. Set to       
                              .TRUE. if the eigenvalues of X          
                              are repeated (within a small tolerance).

 double precision   X      >  Array containing the components of a    
                              symmetric tensor.
