 DESCRIPTION
 Derivative of exponential map for general three-dimensional tensors
                                                                    
 This routine computes the derivative of the exponential of a       
 generally unsymmetric three-dimensional tensor.                    
 It uses the series definition of the tensor exponential.           
 The exponential map itself is implemented in subroutine EXPMAP.    
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   DEXPX  <  Derivative of the exponential map at X. 
                              This derivative is a fourth order       
                              tensor stored here as a 4-index array.  

 logical            NOCONV <  Logical convergence flag. Set to        
                              .TRUE. if the series fail to converge   
                              Set to .FALSE. otherwise.               

 double precision   X      >  Tensor at which exponential derivative  
                              is to be computed.
