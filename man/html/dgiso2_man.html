 DESCRIPTION
 Derivative of a general isotropic tensor function of one tensor    
                                                                    
 This function computes the derivative, dY(X)/dX, of a general      
 isotropic tensor function of one tensor, Y(X). This implementation 
 is restricted to 2-D with one possible out-of-plane component      
 (normally needed in axisymmetric problems). The tensor function    
 Y(X) is assumed to be defined as Y(X)= Sum[yi(x1,x2,x3) ei(x)ei],  
 where yi are the eigenvalues of the tensor Y and xi the eigenvalues
 of the tensor X. ei are the egenvectors of X (which by definition  
 of Y(X), coincide with those of tensor Y) and "(x)" denotes the    
 tensor product.

 double precision   DEIGY  >  Matrix containing the derivatives       
                              dyi/dxj of the eigenvalues of Y(X) with 
                              respect to the eigenvalues of X.

                              (fourth order tensor) dY/dX.            

 double precision   EIGPRJ >  Matrix with each column containing the  
                              components of one eigenprojection tensor
                              ei(x)ei.                                

 double precision   EIGX   >  Array of eigenvalues of X.              

 double precision   EIGY   >  Array of eigenvalues of Y.              

 logical            OUTOFP >  Out-of-plane component flag. If set to  
                              .TRUE. the out-of-plane                 
                              component (normally required in         
                              axisymmetric problems) is computed.     
                              The out-of-plane component is not       
                              computed otherwise.                     

 logical            REPEAT >  Repeated in-plane eigenvalues flag.     
                              If the in-plane eigenvalues are repeated
                              this argument must be set to            
                              .TRUE. on entry, so that the            
                              appropriate limit expression for the    
                              the derivative is employed.
