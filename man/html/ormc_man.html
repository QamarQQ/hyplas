 DESCRIPTION
 Output results for the Mohr-Coulomb elasto-plastic material model  
                                                                    
 This routine writes to the results file the internal and           
 algorithmic variables of the Mohr-Coulomb elasto-plastic material  
 with non-linear isotropic hardening. The results printed here      
 are obtained by the return mapping algorithm implemented in routine
 SUMC.
