 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for the Mohr-Coulomb type material model.   
                                                                    
 This routine uses the fully implicit elastic predictor/return      
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for the            
 Mohr-Coulomb elasto-plastic material model with piece-wise linear  
 isotropic hardening. It contains the plane strain and axisymmetric 
 implementations of the model. The essential return mapping is      
 carried out here in principal stress space.
