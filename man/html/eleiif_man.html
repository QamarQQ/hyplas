 DESCRIPTION
 Element interface for internal force vector calculation            
                                                                    
 This routine calls the internal force vector calculation routines  
 for all element classes available in HYPLAS.                       
 If the internal force vector calculation fails for some reason     
 (such as due to failure of a material-specific state update        
 procedure) the return value of the logical argument IFFAIL will be 
 .TRUE., which will activate the increment cutting procedure in the 
 main program.                                                      
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 integer            IELEM  >  Number of the element whose internal    
                              force vector is to be computed.         

 logical            IFFAIL <  Internal force computation failure flag.
                              Return value set to .FALSE. if internal 
                              force vector was successfully evaluated 
                              and set to .TRUE. otherwise.
