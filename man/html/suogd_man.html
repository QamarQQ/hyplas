 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for the Ogden hyperelastic material model.  
                                                                    
 This routine updates the Cauchy stress and other state variables   
 for the regularised (compressible) Ogden hyperelastic material     
 model under plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric states.    
 Under plane stress, the model is exactly incompressible rather     
 than regularised. Under plane strain and axisymmetric conditions,  
 the regularised (penalty type) approach is adopted to enforce      
 incompressibility. In the regularised approach, the bulk modulus   
 plays the role of the incompressibility penalty factor.            
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   B      >  Array of components of the Left         
                              Cauchy-Green strain tensor.             

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   

 integer            NTYPE  >  Stress state type flag. This routine    
                              accepts NTYPE=1 (plane stress)          
                              NTYPE=2 (plane strain) and              
                              NTYPE=3 (axisymmetric).                 

 double precision   RPROPS >  Array of real material properties.      

 double precision   RSTAVA <  Array of real state variables other than
                              stress tensor components. Use here to   
                              store the left Cauchy-Green strain      
                              tensor.                                 

 double precision   STRES  <  Array of Cauchy stress components.      

 double precision   THICK  <> Thickness of the current point. Initial 
                              (reference) value on entry, current     
                              updated value on return.                
                              Used only in plane stress analysis.
