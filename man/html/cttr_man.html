 DESCRIPTION
 Consistent tangent matrix for the Tresca model                     
                                                                    
 The tangent matrix computed in this routine is consistent with     
 fully implicit elastic predictor/return mapping algorithm for the  
 Tresca elasto-plastic material model with piece-wise linear        
 isotropic hardening carried out in subroutine SUTR.                
 This routine contains the plane strain and axisymmetric            
 implementations of the model.                                      
 It returns either the elastic tangent or the elasto-plastic        
 consistent tangent matrix depending on the input value of          
 the logical argument EPFLAG.                                       
 The present implementation is based on the use of closed formulae  
 for the derivatives of general isotropic                           
 tensor functions of one tensor in which the eigenvalues of the     
 function are expressed as functions (the algorithmic incremental   
 principal stress-based constitutive relation in the present case)  
 of the eigenvalues of its tensor argument.

                              If .FALSE., DMATX returns as the elastic
                              matrix. If .TRUE., DMATX returns as the 
                              elasto-plastic tangent consistent with  
                              the return mapping algorithm implemented
