 DESCRIPTION
 Consistent tangent for the Drucker-Prager model in plane stress.   
                                                                    
 This routine computes the tangent matrix consistent with the       
 nested iteration algorithm for the Drucker-Prager model in         
 plane stress coded in subroutine SUDPPN.                           
 It returns either the elastic tangent or the elasto-plastic        
 consistent tangent matrix depending on the input value of          
 the logical argument EPFLAG.

 double precision   RALGVA >  Array of real algorithmic variables.    
                              For the present plane stress            
                              implementation, it contains the         
                              incremental plastic multipliers obtained
                              in routine SUDPPN and the elastic trial 
                              thickness strain obtained as the        
                              solution of the plane stress enforcement
                              loop of SUDPPN.                         
                              Note that for the first iteration of a  
                              load increment the incremental plastic  
                              multipliers must be set to zero and     
                              elastic trial thickness strain must be  
                              set equal to the elastic thickness      
                              strain of the previous equilibrium      
                              solution.                               

 double precision   DMATX  <  Plane stress consistent tangent matrix. 

 logical            EPFLAG >  Elasto-plastic flag.                    
                              If .FALSE., DMATX returns as the elastic
                              matrix (the standard plane stress linear
                              elasticity matrix).                     
                              If .TRUE., DMATX returns as the         
                              as the elasto-plastic tangent consistent
                              with the nested iteration algorithm     
                              implemented in routine SUDPPN.          

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              This array is set in routines INDATA

                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element of this array used here.
