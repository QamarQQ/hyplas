 DESCRIPTION
 State update for the von Mises model with mixed hardening.         
                                                                    
 This routine uses the fully implicit elastic predictor/return      
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for the von Mises  
 elasto-plastic material model with general non-linear (piece-wise  
 linear) mixed isotropic/kinematic hardening under plane strain and 
 axisymmetric conditions.                                           
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   DGAMA  <  Incremental plastic multiplier.         

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curves is the only     
                              element of this array used here.        
                              This array is set in routines MATIRD    
                              and RDVMMX.                             

 logical            LALGVA <  Array of logical algorithmic flags.     
                              For the present material model, this    
                              array contains the plastic yielding     
                              flag and the return algorithm failure   
                              flag. The plastic yielding flag is set  
                              to .TRUE. if plastic yielding           
                              has occurred and to .FALSE. if          
                              the step is elastic. The algorithm      
                              failure flag is set to .FALSE. if       
                              the state update algorithm has been     
                              successful and to .TRUE. if the         
                              return mapping algorithm has failed     
                              to converge.                            

 integer            NTYPE  >  Stress state type flag. The present     
                              routine is compatible only with NTYPE=2 
                              (plane strain) and NTYPE=3              
                              (axisymmetric condition).

                              hardening curve and the pairs
