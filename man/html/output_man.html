 DESCRIPTION
 Prints displacements, reactions and other variables to results file
                                                                    
 This routine prints the nodal displacements and reactions and      
 Gauss-point and nodal averaged values of stresses and other state  
 and algorithmic variables to the results file. The argument NOUTP  
 controls what results are to be printed out.

 double precision   TFACT  >  Total proportional load factor.         

 integer            IINCS  >  Current load increment number.          

 integer            IITER  >  Equilibrium iteration at which          
                              convergence was achieved in the current 
                              load step.                              

 integer            NOUTP  >  Load output flag that determines what   
                              results are to be printed out.
