 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for Lemaitre's ductile damage model.        
                                                                    
 This routine uses the fully implicit elastic predictor/return      
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for Lemaitre's     
 ductile damage elasto-plastic model with general non-linear        
 (piece-wise linear) isotropic hardening under plane strain and     
 axisymmetric conditions.

 double precision   DGAMA  <  Incremental plastic multiplier.         

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element of this array used here.        
                              This array is set in routines           
                              INDATA and RDDAMA.                      

 logical            LALGVA <  Array of logical algorithmic flags.     
                              For the present material model, this    
                              array contains the plastic yielding     
                              flag and the return algorithm failure   
                              flag. The plastic yielding flag is set  
                              to .TRUE. if plastic yielding has       
                              occurred and to .FALSE. if the step is  
                              elastic. The algorithm failure flag is  
                              set to .FALSE. if the state update      
                              algorithm has been successful and to    
                              .TRUE. if the return mapping algorithm  
                              has failed to converge.                 

 integer            NTYPE  >  Stress state type flag. The present     
                              routine is compatible only with NTYPE=2 
                              (plane strain) and NTYPE=3 (axisymmetric
                              condition).

                              (not used in this routine), the elastic 
                              properties: Young's modulus and         
                              Poisson's ratio, the two damage         
                              evolution constants and the pairs

                              curve. This array is set in routine     
                              RDDAMA.
