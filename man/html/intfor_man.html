 DESCRIPTION
 Calls internal force vector calculation routines                   
                                                                    
 This routine calls the internal force vector calculation routines  
 for all element classes available in HYPLAS. It loops over all     
 elements of the mesh. If the internal force vector calculation     
 fails for some reason (such as due to failure of an state update   
 procedure) the return value of the logical argument INCCUT will be 
 .TRUE., which will activate the increment cutting procedure in the 
 main program.                                                      
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 logical            INCCUT <  Increment cutting flag. Return value set
                              to .FALSE. if internal force vector was 
                              successfully evaluated and set to .TRUE.
                              otherwise.                              
                              When the return value is set to .TRUE., 
                              the main program will activate increment
                              cutting and the current increment will  
                              be divided into sub-increments.
