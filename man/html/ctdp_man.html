 DESCRIPTION
 Consistent tangent matrix for the Drucker-Prager model             
                                                                    
 The tangent matrix computed in this routine is consistent with     
 fully implicit elastic predictor/return mapping algorithm for the  
 Drucker-Prager elasto-plastic material model with piece-wise linear
 isotropic hardening carried out in subroutine SUDP.                
 It contains only the plane strain and axisymmetric implementations.
 It returns either the elastic tangent or the elasto-plastic        
 consistent tangent matrix depending on the input value of          
 the logical argument EPFLAG.

 double precision   DGAM   >  Incremental plastic multipliers obtained
                              in routine SUDP.                        

 double precision   DMATX  <  Consistent tangent matrix.              

 logical            EPFLAG >  Elasto-plastic flag.                    
                              If .FALSE., DMATX returns as the elastic
                              matrix. If .TRUE., DMATX returns as the 
                              elasto-plastic tangent consistent with  
                              the return mapping algorithm implemented
                              in routine SUDP.

                              This array is set in routines           
                              INDATA and RDDP.                        
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element of this array used here.

 double precision   RPROPS >  Array of real material properties.      
                              Same as in the argument list of
