 DESCRIPTION
 Computes the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor                       
                                                                    
 Given the previous total left Cauchy-Green strain tensor and the   
 incremental deformation gradient between the previous and current  
 configuration, this routine computes the current left Cauchy-Green 
 strain tensor. This routine contains the plane strain, plane stress
 and axisymmetric implementations.

 double precision   BNP1   <  Array of components of the current (at  
                              tn+1) left Cauchy-Green strain tensor.

                              the previous and current configuration.

                              compatible with NTYPE=1 (plane          
                              stress), NTYPE=2 (plane strain)         
                              and NTYPE=3 (axisymmetric condition).
