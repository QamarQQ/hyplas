 DESCRIPTION
 Read data for the von Mises plasticity model with mixed hardening. 
                                                                    
 This routine reads from the data file and echos to the results file
 the material parameters necessary for                              
 the von Mises elasto-plastic model with piece-wise linear          
 mixed isotropic/kinematic hardening.                               
 It also sets the array of real properties and some components of   
 the array of integer material properties.                          
 These arrays are used by subroutines SUVMMX and CTVMMX.            
 This routine also checks whether the number of integer and real    
 material properties, the number of real state variables and the    
 number of logical algorithmic variables required by the present    
 model                                                              
 is compatible with the dimension of the corresponding global       
 arrays.                                                            
 It also sets the unsymmetric tangent stiffness flag.
