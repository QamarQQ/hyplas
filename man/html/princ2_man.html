 DESCRIPTION
 Computes the principal stresses and their angle in 2-D.            
                                                                    
 This routine computes the eigenvalues of the stress tensor in 2-D  
 and the angle of the system of eingenvectors relative to the       
 system where the stress components are expressed.
