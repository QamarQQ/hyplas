 DESCRIPTION
 Consistent tangent matrix for the Tresca model in plane stress.    
                                                                    
 The tangent matrix computed in this routine is consistent with the 
 nested iteration algorithm for the Tresca model in plane stress    
 coded in subroutine SUTRPN.                                        
 It returns either the elastic tangent or the elasto-plastic        
 consistent tangent matrix depending on the input value of          
 the logical argument EPFLAG.                                       
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   DMATX  <  Consistent tangent matrix.              

 logical            EPFLAG >  Elasto-plastic flag.                    
                              If .FALSE., DMATX returns as the elastic
                              as the elastic matrix. If .TRUE., DMATX 
                              returns as the elasto-plastic tangent   
                              consistent with the return mapping      
                              algorithm implemented in routine SUTR.  

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              This array is set in routines INDATA    
                              and RDTR.                               
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element of this array used here.

                              subroutine SUTR.
