 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for the Tresca elasto-plastic model.        
                                                                    
 This routine uses the fully implicit elastic predictor/return      
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for the Tresca     
 elasto-plastic material model with piece-wise linear isotropic     
 hardening. It contains the plane strain and the axisymmetric       
 implementations of the model.                                      
 The essential return mapping is carried out here in the principal  
 stress space.

                              to converge.

                              if the selected return mapping is to    
                              a corner (right or left) and is set to  
                              .FALSE. otherwise.
