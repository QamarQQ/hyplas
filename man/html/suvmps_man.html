 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for the von Mises model in plane stress.    
                                                                    
 This routine uses the fully implicit elastic predictor/return      
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for the von Mises  
 elasto-plastic material model with general non-linear (piece-wise  
 linear) isotropic hardening under plane stress condition.          
 The algorithm used here is derived from the plane stress-projected 
 von Mises model, in which only in-plane stress/strain components   
 take part in the evolution equations.                              
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   DGAMA  <  Incremental plastic multiplier.         

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element of this array used here.        
                              This array is set in routines INDATA    
                              and RDVM.                               

 logical            LALGVA <  Array of logical algorithmic flags.     
                              For the present material model, this    
                              array contains the plastic yielding     
                              flag and the return algorithm failure   
                              flag. The plastic yielding flag is set  
                              to .TRUE. if plastic yielding           
                              has occurred and to .FALSE. if          
                              the step is elastic. The algorithm      
                              failure flag is set to .FALSE. if       
                              the state update algorithm has been     
                              successful and to .TRUE. if the         
                              return mapping algorithm has failed     
                              to converge.

                              This array contains the density         
                              (not used in this routine), the elastic 
                              properties: Young's modulus and         
                              Poisson's ratio, and the pairs
