 DESCRIPTION
 Read data for planar double-slip single crystal model.             
                                                                    
 This routine reads from the data file and echos to the results file
 the material parameters necessary for the large strain             
 planar double-slip single crystal elasto-plastic model with        
 piece-wise linear isotropic Taylor hardening.                      
 It also sets the array of real properties and some components of   
 the array of integer material properties.                          
 These arrays are used by subroutines SUPDSC and CSTPDS.            
 This routine also checks whether the number of integer and real    
 material properties, the number of real state variables and the    
 number of logical and real algorithmic variables required by the   
 present model is compatible with the dimension of the corresponding
 global arrays.                                                     
 It also sets the unsymmetric tangent stiffness flag.
