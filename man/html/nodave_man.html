 DESCRIPTION
 Computes and prints averaged nodal values of Gauss-point variables.
                                                                    
 This routine computes and prints the averaged (smoothed) nodal     
 values of stresses and other state and algorithmic variables. The  
 smoothed value of each variable at a node is computed by firstly   
 extrapolating the value of the variable from the Gauss-points to   
 the node in question and then averaging the extrapolated values    
 obtained from all elements sharing that node. The values computed  
 here are used in HYPLAS only for the purpose of output.
