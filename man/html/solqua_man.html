 DESCRIPTION
 Solves a quadratic equation:  a x**2 + b x + c = 0                 
                                                                    
 Given the coeficients a, b and c, this routine computes the real   
 roots of the associated quadratic equation, a x**2 + b x + c = 0.  
 The return values of the arguments ROOT1 and ROOT2 (the roots) are 
 set only if real roots exist.                                      
 If the equation admits only one real solution, the return value    
 of the logical argument ONEROO is set to .TRUE. (set to .FALSE.    
 otherwise).                                                        
 If the equation admits two real roots, the return value            
 of the logical argument TWOROO is set to .TRUE.  (set to .FALSE.   
 otherwise).                                                        
 Consequently, if the roots are complex or no roots/infinite        
 number of roots exist (the equation is ill-defined), the return    
 value of the logical arguments ONEROO and TWOROO is set to .FALSE. 
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   A      >  Coefficient of the quadratic term.      

 double precision   B      >  Coefficient of the linear term.         

 double precision   C      >  Coefficient of the constant term.       

 logical            ONEROO <  Logical flag. Set to .TRUE. if          
                              there is only one (real) root.          
                              Set to .FALSE. otherwise.               

 logical            TWOROO <  Logical flag. Set to .TRUE. if          
                              there are two distinct (real) root.     
                              Set to .FALSE. otherwise.               

 double precision   ROOT1  <  One of the roots (the only root if there
                              is only one real root - not set if there
                              are no real roots).                     

 double precision   ROOT2  <  The other root (not set if there is only
                              one real root or no real roots).
