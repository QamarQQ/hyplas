 DESCRIPTION
 Switches the stored value of the problem variables.                
                                                                    
 This routine switches the stored values of the problem variables   
 (displacements, coordinates, stresses and other state and          
 algorithmic variables) between current values and values at the    
 last converged (equilibrium) solution. The value of the argument   
 MODE defines what switching operation is carried out. If MODE=1,   
 the current value of the variables is assigned to the converged    
 solution and the equilibrium values of the previous step are       
 discarded (this is required when convergence is achieved at the end
 of the current equilibrium iteration).  If MODE=2, the values at   
 the last converged solution are assigned to the current values and 
 the values at the end of the previous iteration (if any) are       
 discarded (this operation is carried out whenever a new iteration  
 is required by the iterative method for equilibrium solution). If  
 MODE=3, the values at the last converged solution are assigned to  
 the current values when increment cutting is required. Gauss-point 
 thicknesses are also switched accordingly (for large strains under 
 plane stress only).
