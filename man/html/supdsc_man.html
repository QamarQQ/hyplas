 DESCRIPTION
 State update for the planar double-slip single crystal model.      
                                                                    
 This routine uses an implicit elastic predictor/return             
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for the            
 anisotropic finite strain planar double-slip single crystal model  
 with Taylor isotropic hardening. This model is compatible only     
 with the plane strain assumption.                                  
 It has two slip planes comprising a total of four slip directions  
 (two directions opposite to each other in each plane).

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element of this array used here.        
                              This array is set in routines INDATA and
                              RDTR.                                   

 logical            LALGVA <  Array of logical algorithmic flags.     
                              For the present material model, this    
                              array contains the plastic yielding     
                              flag, IFPLAS, the state update failure  
                              flag, SUFAIL and the active slip-system 
                              flags, S1ACT, S2ACT, S3ACT and S4ACT.   
                              The plastic yielding flag is set to     
                              .TRUE. if plastic yielding has occurred 
                              and to .FALSE. if the step is elastic.  
                              The algorithm failure flag is set to    
                              .FALSE. if the state update algorithm   
                              has been successful and to .TRUE. if the
                              return mapping algorithm has failed for 
                              any reason.                             
                              Each active slip-system flags is set to 
                              .TRUE. only if the                      
                              corresponding system is currently       
                              active, i.e., S1ACT is set to .TRUE.    
                              if system 1 is active, S2ACT is set to  
                              .TRUE. if system 2 is active and so on. 
                              Each flag will be set to .FALSE. if the 
                              corresponding system is not currently   
                              active.                                 

 integer            NTYPE  >  Stress state type flag. The present     
                              implementation is compatible only with  
                              plane strain (NTYPE=2).                 

 double precision   RPROPS >  Array of real material properties.

                              properties: Shear and bulk modulus

                              properties: the pairs ``Taylor hardening

                              curve. This array is set in routine     
                              RDPDSC.
