 DESCRIPTION
 Spatial elasticity tensor for the Ogden hyperelastic material model
                                                                    
 This routine computes the spatial elasticity tensor, a, for the    
 regularised Ogden hyperelastic material model under plane stress,  
 plane strain and axisymmetric conditions. Note that under plane    
 stress the model implemented here is exactly incompressible,       
 whereas under plane strain and axisymmetric conditions the         
 regularised (penalty type) approach is used to enforce             
 incompressibility. The (Cauchy) stress tensor components of the    
 Ogden hyperelastic model under plane stress/strain and axisymmetric
 states are evaluated in subroutine SUOGD.
