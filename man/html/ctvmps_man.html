 DESCRIPTION
 Consistent tangent matrix for von Mises model in plane stress.     
                                                                    
 This routine computes the tangent matrix consistent with the       
 plane stress-projected implicit elastic predictor/return mapping   
 algorithm for the von Mises model coded in subroutine SUVMPS.      
 It returns either the elastic tangent or the elasto-plastic        
 consistent tangent matrix depending on the input value of          
 the logical argument EPFLAG.
