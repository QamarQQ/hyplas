 DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION <a href=plfun.html>PLFUN</a> - MANUAL PAGE

 DESCRIPTION
 Returns the value of a piece-wise linear scalar function           
                                                                    
 This function returns the value of a piece-wise linear scalar      
 function F(X) defined by a set of NPOINT pairs (X,F(X)) passed in  
 the matrix argument XFX.                                           
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   X      >  Point at which the function will be     
                              evaluated.                              

 integer            NPOINT >  Number of points defining the piece-wise
                              linear function.                        

 double precision   XFX    >  Matrix (dimension 2*NPOINT)             
                              containing the pairs (x,f(x)) which     
                              define the piece-wise linear function.  
                              evaluated. Each column of XFX           
                              contains a pair (xi,f(xi)). The pairs   
                              supplied in XFX                         
                              must be ordered such that the x's are   
                              monotonically increasing. That is, the  
                              x [XFX(1,i+1)] of a column i+1 must be  
                              greater than XFX(1,i) (x of column i).  
                              If X < XFX(1,1) the                     
                              piece-wise linear function is assumed   
                              constant equal to XFX(1,1).             
                              If X > XFX(1,NPOINT) the                
                              piece-wise linear function is assumed   
                              constant equal to XFX(1,NPOINT).
