 DESCRIPTION
 Reads data for the regularised Ogden hyperelastic material model.  
                                                                    
 This routine reads from the data file and echoes to the results    
 file the material parameters required by the regularised Ogden     
 hyperelastic material model.  It also sets the array of real       
 properties and some components of the array of integer material    
 properties.  These arrays are used by subroutines SUOGD and CTOGD. 
 Note that under plane stress the model implemented here is exactly 
 incompressible, whereas under plane strain and axisymmetric        
 conditions the regularised (penalty type) approach is used to      
 enforce incompressibility. This routine also sets the unsymmetric  
 tangent stiffness flag.
