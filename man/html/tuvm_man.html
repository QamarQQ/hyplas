 DESCRIPTION
 Thickness update for large strain von Mises model in plane stress  
                                                                    
 This routine updates the thickness for the von Mises model under   
 plane stress and large strains. It also computes the total         
 deformation gradient (including the thickness strain contribution).
 The corresponding state update procedure for the von Mises model   
 is carried out in subroutine SUVMPS.                               
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   DETF   <> Determinant of the current in-plane     
                              deformation gradient on entry. Returns  
                              as the determinant of the current total 
                              deformation gradient (including the     
                              thickness strain contribution).         

 double precision   RSTAVA >  Array of current (updated) real state   
                              variables other than the stress tensor  
                              components.                             

 double precision   THICK  <> Initial (reference) thickness on entry. 
                              Returns as the current (updated)        
                              thickness.                              

 integer            MODE   >  Flag. If MODE.NE.1, then only the total 
                              deformation gradient is computed.       
                              If MODE = 1, then the thickness is      
                              updated in addition.
