 DESCRIPTION
 Prints error message and can abort the program if requested        
                                                                    
 This routine prints error/warning messages to the standard output  
 and results file and may abort the program depending on the entry  
 value of its argument. The character string passed as its argument 
 is an error code which will be searched for in the file ERROR.RUN, 
 assumed to be kept in the directory defined by the HYPLASHOME      
 environment variable. If the correponding character string (error  
 code) is found, the associated error/warning message is printed    
 in the standard output and results file.                           
 The are 5 types of errors/warnings: Input data error, input data   
 warning, internal error, execution error and execution warning.    
 These are characterised, respectively, by error codes of the       
 types: 'ED????', 'WD????', 'EI????', 'EE????' and 'WE????'.        
 This routine aborts the program in case of input data error        
 (ED????), internal error ('EI????') or execution error (EE????).   
 The execution of the program is not interrupted in case of         
 warnings ('WE????' or 'WD????').                                   
 See file ERROR.RUN for more details.
