 DESCRIPTION
 Sets Gaussian quadrature constants for 2-D domains                 
                                                                    
 Given the type of domain and the required number of integration    
 points, this routine sets the sampling point positions and the     
 corresponding weights following standard Gauss quadrature rules    
 for 2-D domains (quadrilateral and triangular domains).

 character          DOMAIN >  Character string with domain type flag. 
                              Entry value of DOMAIN can be either     
                              'QUA' (for quadrilateral domains or     
                              'TRI' (for triangular domains).         

 integer            NGAUS  >  Number of integration points.           

 double precision   POSGP  <  Array containing the position of the    
                              integration points.                     

 double precision   WEIGP  <  Array containing the weights of the     
                              integration points.
