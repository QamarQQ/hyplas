 DESCRIPTION
 Computes the value of isotropic tensor functions of one tensor.    
                                                                    
 This subroutine evaluates isotropic tensor functions Y(X), of one  
 tensor belonging to the class described below.                     
 This implementation is restricted to 2-D with one possible         
 out-of-plane component (normally needed in axisymmetric problems). 
 The class of symmetric tensor functions Y(X) is assumed to be      
 defined as Y(X)= Sum[y(xi) ei(x)ei], where the scalar function     
 y(xi) defines the eigenvalues of the tensor Y and xi the           
 eigenvalues of the tensor X. ei are the egenvectors of X (which by 
 definition of Y(X), coincide with those of tensor Y) and "(x)"     
 denotes the tensor product.

 symbolic name      FUNC   >  Symbolic name of the double             
                              precision function defining y(xi).      

 logical            OUTOFP >  Out-of-plane component flag. If set to  
                              .TRUE. the out-of-plane                 
                              component (normally required in         
                              axisymmetric problems) is computed.     
                              The out-of-plane component is not       
                              computed otherwise.
