 DESCRIPTION
 Consistent tangent matrix for the Mohr-Coulomb model               
                                                                    
 The tangent matrix computed in this routine is consistent with     
 fully implicit elastic predictor/return mapping algorithm for the  
 Mohr-Coulomb elasto-plastic material model with piece-wise linear  
 isotropic hardening carried out in subroutine SUMC.                
 It contains the plane strain and axisymmetric implementations of   
 the model.                                                         
 It returns either the elastic tangent or the elasto-plastic        
 consistent tangent matrix depending on the input value of EPFLAG.  
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   DMATX  <  Consistent tangent matrix.              

 logical            EPFLAG >  Elasto-plastic flag.                    
                              If .FALSE., DMATX returns as the elastic
                              matrix. If .TRUE., DMATX returns as the 
                              elasto-plastic tangent consistent with  
                              the return mapping algorithm implemented
                              in routine SUMC.                        

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              This array is set in routines INDATA and
                              RDMC.                                   
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element of this array used here.        

 logical            LALGVA >  Array of logical algorithmic flags.

 double precision   RPROPS >  Array of real material properties.      
                              Same as in the argument list of         
                              subroutine SUMC.
