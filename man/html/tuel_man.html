 DESCRIPTION
 Thickness update for Hencky elastic model in plane stress          
                                                                    
 This routine updates the thickness for the (Hencky) elastic model  
 under plane stress and large strains. It also computes the total   
 deformation gradient (including the thickness strain contribution).
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 double precision   DETF   <  Determinant of the current total        
                              deformation gradient (including the     
                              thickness strain contribution).         

 double precision   RSTAVA >  Array of current (updated) engineering  
                              logarithmic strain components.          

 double precision   THICK  <> Initial (reference) thickness on entry. 
                              Returns as the current (updated)        
                              thickness.                              

 integer   MODE            >  Flag. If MODE.NE.1, then only the total 
                              deformation gradient is computed.       
                              If MODE = 1, then the thickness is      
                              updated in addition.
