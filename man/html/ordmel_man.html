 DESCRIPTION
 Output results for the damaged elastic/crack closure model.        
                                                                    
 This routine writes to the results file some state variables for   
 the isotropically damaged isotropic elastic model accounting for   
 partial microcrack/void closure effects (quasi-unilateral          
 conditions) under compressive stresses.
