 DESCRIPTION
 Material interface for state update routine calls                  
                                                                    
 This routine calls the state update routine according to the       
 material type. Given the material-independent kinematic quantities 
 computed at the element level (and passed into the present routine 
 through its list of arguments) this routine identifies the material
 type in question and calls the corresponding material-specific     
 state update routine which updates the stress and other state      
 variables at one Gauss point.                                      
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST

 double precision   DETF   >  Determinant of the total deformation    
                              gradient at the current Gauss point.    
                              Used for large strain analysis only.    

 integer            NLARGE >  Large strain flag. Large strain         
                              analysis if NLARGE=1 and

 integer            NTYPE  >  Stress state type flag.                 

 logical            SUFAIL <  State update failure flag. Return value 
                              set to .FALSE. if the state update      
                              procedure was performed successfully    
                              and set to .TRUE. otherwise.            

 double precision   THKGP  <> Thickness of the current Gauss point.
