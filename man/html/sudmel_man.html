 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for damaged elastic/crack closure model.    
                                                                    
 Given the total strain, this routine computes the corresponding    
 stress using for an isotropically damaged isotropic linear elastic 
 model accounting for partial microcrack/void closure effects       
 (quasi-unilateral conditions) under compressive stresses.          
 This routine contains the plane strain and axisymmetric            
 implementations of the model.                                      
                                                                    

 ARGUMENT LIST
 Type               Name      Description

 integer            NTYPE  >  Stress state type flag. The present     
                              routine is compatible with NTYPE=1      
                              (plane stress), NTYPE=2 (plane strain)  
                              and NTYPE=3 (axisymmetric condition).   

 double precision   RPROPS >  Array of real material properties.      

 double precision   RSTAVA <  Array of real state variables other     
                              than the stress tensor components.      
                              For this model , this array stores the  
                              (engineering) strain components.        

 double precision   STRAN  >  Array of current total (engineering)    
                              strain components.                      

 double precision   STRES  <  Array of updated stress tensor          
                              components.                             

 logical            SUFAIL <  Logical flag for stress update procedure
                              failure. Set to .TRUE. if the algorithm 
                              failed to update the stress. Set to     
                              .FALSE. is the stress was successfully  
                              updated.
