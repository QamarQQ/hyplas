 DESCRIPTION
 Derivative of a class of isotropic tensor function of one tensor   
                                                                    
 This function computes the derivative, dY(X)/dX, of a particular   
 class of symmetric isotropic tensor valued function of one         
 symmetric tensor, Y(X).                                            
 This implementation is restricted to 2-D with one possible         
 out-of-plane component (normally needed in axisymmetric problems). 
 The class of tensor functions Y(X) is assumed to be defined as     
 Y(X)= Sum[y(xi) ei(x)ei], where the scalar function y(xi) defines  
 the eigenvalues of the tensor Y and xi the eigenvalues of the      
 tensor X. ei are the egenvectors of X (which by definition of      
 Y(X), coincide with those of tensor Y) and "(x)" denotes the       
 tensor product.

                              function defining the derivative        
                              dy(x)/dx of the eigenvalues of the      
                              tensor function.

                              function defining the eigenvalues y(x)

 logical            OUTOFP >  Out-of-plane component flag. If set to  
                              .TRUE. the out-of-plane                 
                              component (normally required in         
                              axisymmetric problems) is computed.     
                              The out-of-plane component is not       
                              computed otherwise.
