 DESCRIPTION
 Arrange a fourth order tensor in matrix form with G matrix ordering
                                                                    
 This routine re-arranges a given fourth order tensor, stored as a  
 4-index array, in matrix form (2-index array) using G matrix       
 component ordering.                                                
 Implemented only for 2-D tensors.
