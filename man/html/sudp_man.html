 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for the Drucker-Prager material model.      
                                                                    
 This routine uses the fully implicit elastic predictor/return      
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for the            
 Drucker elasto-plastic material model with piece-wise linear       
 isotropic hardening. This routine contains only the plane strain   
 and axisymmetric implementations of the model.

 integer            IPROPS >  Array of integer material properties.   
                              The number of points on the piece-wise  
                              linear hardening curve is the only      
                              element stored in this array used here. 
                              This array is set in routines           
                              INDATA and RDDP.                        

 logical            LALGVA <  Array of logical algorithmic flags.     
                              For the present material model, this    
                              array contains the plastic yielding     
                              flag, IFPLAS; the return algorithm      
                              failure flag, SUFAIL; the apex return   
                              flag, APEX.                             
                              The plastic yielding flag is set to     
                              .TRUE. if plastic yielding has occurred 
                              and to .FALSE. if the step is elastic.  
                              The algorithm failure flag is set to    
                              .FALSE. if the state update algorithm   
                              has been successful and to .TRUE. if the
                              return mapping algorithm has failed to  
                              converge.                               
                              APEX is set to .TRUE. if the selected   
                              return mapping is the return to the     
                              apex. It is set to .FALSE. otherwise.
