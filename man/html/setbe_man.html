 DESCRIPTION
 Obtains the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor from the log strain    
                                                                    
 Given the Eulerian (Lagrangian) logarithmic strain tensor, this    
 routine computes the corresponding left (right) Cauchy-Green       
 strain tensor.                                                     
 Plane strain, plane stress and axisymmetric implementations.       
 In the present implementation, the out-of-plane component is       
 always computed.
