 DESCRIPTION
 Reads (writes) data to input (output) re-start file                
                                                                    
 Depending on the entry value of its argument MODE, this            
 routine either dumps the complete database and current information 
 about the analysis into an output re-start file or reads this      
 information from a previously created re-start file.               
 The information dumped on the output re-start file will enable     
 HYPLAS to re-start from the point in the analysis where the file   
 was generated. To re-start, this file will be read as the input    
 re-start file.
