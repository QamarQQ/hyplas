 DESCRIPTION
 Consistent tangent matrix for von Mises model with mixed hardening.
                                                                    
 This routine computes the tangent matrix consistent with the       
 fully implicit elastic predictor/return mapping algorithm          
 for the von Mises model with mixed hardening coded in subroutine   
 SUVMMX.                                                            
 It contains the plane strain and axisymmetric implementations.     
 It returns either the elastic tangent or the elasto-plastic        
 consistent tangent matrix depending on the input value of          
 the argument EPFLAG.
