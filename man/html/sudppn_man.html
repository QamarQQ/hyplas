 DESCRIPTION
 State update procedure for the Drucker-Prager model. Plane stress. 
                                                                    
 This routine uses the fully implicit elastic predictor/return      
 mapping algorithm as the state update procedure for the            
 Drucker-Prager elasto-plastic material model with general          
 non-linear (piece-wise linear) isotropic hardening under plane     
 stress condition.                                                  
 The algorithm used here is based on the nested iteration approach  
 for enforcement of the plane stress constraint at the Gauss point  
 level.

                              .TRUE. if plastic yielding has occurred 
                              and to .FALSE. if the step is elastic.  
                              The algorithm failure flag is set to    
                              .FALSE. if the state update algorithm   
                              has been successful and to .TRUE. if the
                              return mapping algorithm has failed to  
                              converge.                               
                              APEX is set to .TRUE. if the selected   
                              return mapping is the return to the
