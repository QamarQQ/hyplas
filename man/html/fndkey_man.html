 DESCRIPTION
 Finds and reads a line containing a specified keyword from a file. 
                                                                    
 This routine searches for a given keyword positioned as the first  
 word of a line in a file.                                          
 If the given keyword is found then the corresponding line is read  
 and returned together with the number of words in the line and two 
 integer arrays containing the position of the beginning and end of 
 each word.                                                         
 If there is more than one line in the given file containing the    
 the specified keyword as its first word, then this routine will    
 return the first line found in the search which, in general, does  
 not coincide with the first occurrence of the keyword in the file. 
 In this case, which line is returned depends on which line of the  
 file the search started. Hence, it is recommended that files to be 
 searched contain only one occurrence of the keyword as first word  
 of a line (occurrences of the keyword in positions other than as   
 the first word of a line are not detected by this routine and can  
 safely be present in the file).

                              is found at the beginning of a line in  
                              the specified file and set to           
                              .FALSE. otherwise.                      

 integer            IWBEG  <  Integer array containg the position of  
                              the beginning of each word in the line  
                              containing the specified keyword.       
                              IWBEG(K) is the position of the

 integer            IWEND  <  Integer array containg the position of  
                              the end of each word in the line        
                              containing the specified keyword.       
                              IWEND(K) is the position of the end of  
                              the Kth word in the line.
